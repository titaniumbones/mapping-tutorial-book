    "# How We make Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "This interface should (I hope!) allow you to get started with Python and mapping.  There are many different ways to make maps in Python, and we will only explore one path today. In later work we may switch to a different framework, but most of the concepts will apply to other tools, even end-user tools like MapBox or StoryMaps. \n",

    "## Imports: Build your toolbox\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is the most widely-used prgramming language for scientific computing, and has a wide variety of tools for working with data. We get access to those tools by `import` ing them into our project. I won'texplain every one of these tools in this tutorial; imagine, in stead, that you have just started an apprenticeship at an auto mechanic shop.  There are many tools in the building, but you will only learn to use a few of them at first."

A library generally provides a numbero f functions and objects (you can google to learn more about that that means) which you access using so-called \"dot notation\". These are often called the library's API. So for instance, folium has an API entrypoint called `Map`. Once the library is imported, we can access it by issuing the command\n",
