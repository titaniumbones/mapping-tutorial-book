    "You are probably used to working with data in spreadsheets or in a tool like [AirTable](https://www.airtable.com). These tools organize data in **tabular format**  -- each dataset is a rectangle with a certain number of rows and columns.  In data science, we sometims call these structures **data frames**, and python has a special package to work with dataframes called [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org). \n",

    "## Pandas Dataframes\n",
    "Let's import the pandas package and create a simple dataframe.  We'll use a popular open dataset used in many examples on the web, called \"iris\", which records certain physical characteristics of 150 species of irises. \n",

    "Notice that wer're using `import` a little differently here than the last time.  By adding `as pd`, we're telling python \"import as usual, but instead of calling the pandas api with the name `pandas`, we'll use the name `pd`.\"  `pd` is the standard abbreviation used by most pythonistas.\n",

    "There is a lot to learn about pandas, but we'll ignore most of its complexities for now (we'll explore a tiny fraction of its capabilities later). Our real reason for introucing it is to show off an amazing extension of pandas called [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/).

So instead, we have downloaded the dataset in a file near this textbook.\n",
